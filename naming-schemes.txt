Naming Schemes
________________________________________________________________________________

This document will provide the naming schemes used for the nodes in the backend's
graph.

Types: (attribute key="type")
    - room
        * currently includes all rooms. {ballroom, meeting room, etc}
        * ID (attribute key = "id") is the room number. For example, "id":107 is
          room 107 on the 1st floor.
    - bathroom
        * currently there is one "bathroom" node for each set of male & female
          bathrooms.
        * ID is the letter "B", the floor number, then an arbitrary 1 digit 
          identifier for which bathroom it is on that floor. For example, the 
          first floor has 4 bathrooms. They are nodes B11, B12, B13, and B14.
    - stairs
        * currently there is one "stairs" node for both the up and down stairs.
        * ID is the letter "S", the floor number, then an arbitrary 1 digit 
          identifier for which staircase it is on that floor. For example, the 
          first floor has 1 staircase. It is S11. The floor above it (Floor 1M)
          has a linked staircase, S1m1.
    - elevator
        * Very similar to stairs, but the ID starts with the letter "E"
    - hallway
        * There are two kinds of hallway nodes currently.
            - Room entrances: these hallway nodes are named with a letter
              "h", then the room number they are in front of. So in front of
              room 102 is hallway node h102. DO NOT RELY ON THIS in your code.
              for simplicity's sake, when 2 rooms are across from each other,
              there is only 1 halway node between them. Therefore there is no
              h101, because 101 is in front of both h102 and h103.
            - Corners: These are placed at any point in a hallway where a person
              might make a turn. these are named with a letter "C", the floor
              number, then their arbitrary identifier, similar to bathrooms stairs
              and elevators.
