Naming Schemes
________________________________________________________________________________

This document will provide the naming schemes used for the nodes in the backend's
graph.

Types: (attribute key="type")
    - room
        * currently includes all rooms. {ballroom, meeting room, etc}
        * ID (attribute key = "id") is the room number. For example, "id":107 is
          room 107 on the 1st floor.
    - bathroom
        * currently there is one "bathroom" node for each set of male & female
          bathrooms.
        * ID is the letter "B", hyphen, the floor number, hyphen,  then an arbitrary 1 
          digit identifier for which bathroom it is on that floor. For example, 
          the first floor has 4 bathrooms. They are nodes B-1-1, B-1-2, B-1-3, and B-1-4.
    - stairs
        * currently there is one "stairs" node for both the up and down stairs.
        * ID is the letter "S", hyphen, the floor number, hyphen, then an arbitrary 1 digit 
          identifier for which staircase it is on that floor. For example, the 
          first floor has 1 staircase. It is S-1-1. The floor above it (Floor 1M)
          has a linked staircase, S-1m-1.
    - elevator
        * Very similar to stairs, but the ID starts with the letter "E"
    - hallway
        * There are two kinds of hallway nodes currently.
            - Room entrances: these hallway nodes are named with a letter
              "h", hyphen, then the room number they are in front of. So in front of
              room 102 is hallway node h-102. DO NOT RELY ON THIS in your code.
              for simplicity's sake, when 2 rooms are across from each other,
              there is only 1 halway node between them. Therefore there is no
              h-101, because 101 is in front of both h-102 and h-103.
            - Corners: These are placed at any point in a hallway where a person
              might make a turn. these are named with a letter "C", hyphen, the floor
              number, hyphen, then their arbitrary identifier, similar to bathrooms 
              stairs and elevators.
    - image-boundry
        * These are being used to help us bisect the large image of all the 
          floors. There are currently two nodes per floor, a TL (top left) and
          a BR (bottom right). The node ID will be the floor number and the
          corner identifier, separated by a hyphen. Ergo, the two nodes that
          mark the corners for floor 1M are: "1m-TL" and "1m-BR".
